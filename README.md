# Platelet API

This is the API for Platelet. It makes use of Flask, RESTx, SQLALchemy and Marshmallow along with other Flask plugins.

It is a REST API. Refer to api_routes.md or the generated Swagger documentation for more detailed documentation.

## Docker set up

Run:

`docker-compose up`

to build and setup a docker instance.

To prepopulate the database with some data, put a sql file named platelet_init.sql in the root directory.

## Manual setup on Ubuntu 20.04
##### Install needed packages:
`sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-12 python3-venv python3-dev python3-wheel gcc`

##### Install ElasticSearch:
`sudo apt install apt-transport-https`

`wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -`

`sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main"`

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install elasticsearch`

##### Install Redis

`sudo apt install redis`

##### Configure postgresql for local testing:
`sudo nano /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf`

Edit the line:
```
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
```
to:
```
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
```
**This will allow unauthenticated connections on localhost**

##### Restart the services:
`sudo systemctl restart postgresql && sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch && sudo systemctl restart redis`

##### Run the setup script:
`./setup.sh`

Optionally input a json file with premade data to insert into the database. You can also add a password to set for the admin user instead of setting it interactively.

`./setup.sh dev_data.json somepass`

## Run

### API

##### Make sure the services are active:
`sudo systemctl start postgresql && sudo systemctl start elasticsearch`

##### Source the environment:
`source venv/bin/activate`

##### Environment Variables:

###### SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
URI string for the database you are connecting to. E.g.:

`postgres://user:password@some-database-host/database_name`

If no URI is specified it will attempt to connect to a localhost database named platelet_dev

###### CLOUD_PLATFORM

Specify the cloud platform that should be used. Currently only `aws` is available.

###### AWS_ENDPOINT

If specified, it will attempt to connect to another endpoint. This can be useful for mocking AWS for testing (e.g with moto).

###### AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

The access key id for the AWS account you are connecting to.

###### SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

The secret access key for the AWS account you are connecting to.

###### CLOUD_PROFILE_PICTURE_STORE_NAME

The name of the image store on the cloud provider. On AWS this is the name of the bucket that has been created.

###### PROFILE_PROCESSING_DIRECTORY

A directory created locally that the flask process has write access to. Suggested `/tmp/profile_pics`

###### DEFAULT_PROFILE_PICTURE_URL

If a user has no profile picture set in the database, this URL will be returned for their picture instead.

###### CORS_ENABLED

Enable CORS. Defaults to `False`.
When developing locally suggest setting this to `True` so that processes running on another port can access the API (e.g. a React server running on port 3000).

###### CORS_ORIGIN

The origin URL when `CORS_ENABLED` is set to `True`. Defaults to `http://localhost:3000`. Does nothing if `CORS_ENABLED` is set to `False`.

###### REDIS_URL

The URL for the Redis server. Defaults connecting to localhost if none is specified.

###### ELASTICSEARCH_URL

The URL for the ElasticSearch server. Defaults to `None` in which case no connection attempts will be made.

##### Start the server:

In a terminal, export your environment variables and run:

`python app.py`

For profile picture uploads, also run the redis worker. This must have the same environment variables as the Flask server.

`python redis_worker.py`

##### Run the tests (in another terminal):
`source venv/bin/activate`

`cd tests`

`pytest -v .`

(Some fail at the moment when all tests are ran together, but won't fail when ran individually.)

To run individual tests use

`pytest -v . -k "some pattern"`

e.g.:

`pytest -v . -k "users"`

Will run all tests associated with users.

##### Visit root to see the swagger API documentation:

## Development
##### Libraries

When you add a new library with `pip install` run:  
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

##### Database changes

When you make changes that require database migrations run:  
`flask db migrate -m "message"`
